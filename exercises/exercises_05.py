# Exercise 5.1
# Create a function filter_the_ones() that creates a string
# variable funny_fruit with value "b1an11a11n1111a". Iterate
# over the characters in this string and only print those characters
# that are not equal to '1'. Use a for loop and an if statement.


# Exercise 5.2
# Create a function separate_numbers_and_letters() that creates
# a string alphanumeric with value "pr0gr4mm1ng". Iterate over
# the characters in this string and for each of them, print whether
# it is a letter (print "letter") or a number (print "number")
# Use isdigit() and an if-else construction


# Exercise 5.3
# FizzBuzz time! This is a classic programming challenge.
# Write a function fizzbuzz() that prints the numbers from
# 1 to 100 to the console output, but:
# - If the number can be divided by 3, print "Fizz"
# - If the number can be divided by 5, print "Buzz"
# - If the number can be divided by 3 AND by 5, print "FizzBuzz"
