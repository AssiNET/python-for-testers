# Exercise 7.1
# Create a class Account and an __init__ constructor method
# that takes (after self) two additional parameters:
# - balance (representing the account balance, e.g. 1000)
# - type (representing the type of account, e.g. "savings")

# Exercise 7.2
# Create three class methods:
# - withdraw (taking, next to self, one argument amount)
#   that withdraws the given amount from the balance
# - deposit (taking, next to self, one argument amount)
#   that deposits the given amount to the balance
# - add_interest (taking, next to self, one argument interest_rate)
#   that adds the given interest rate to the amount (where e.g. 0.05 represent 5%)

# Exercise 7.3
# Create a new instance of the Account class with an initial balance of 1000
# Then:
# 1. Withdraw 500
# 2. Deposit 750
# 3. Add 5% interest, but only if the account type is "savings"
# 4. Print the resulting balance
