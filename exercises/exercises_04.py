# Exercise 4.1
# Create a function count_to_ten that prints the numbers 1 through 10
# Use a while loop


# Exercise 4.2
# Create a function list_my_cars that creates a list my_cars of car brands
# with three cars in there (e.g. Ford, Alfa Romeo, Maserati)
# Use a for loop to iterate over the list and print each car brand


# Exercise 4.3
# Create a function list_my_cars_with_colors that creates a dictionary
# of cars, where the key-value pairs are car brands and their colors, respectively
# (e.g., Ford - blue, Alfa Romeo - red, Maserati - black)
# Use a for-loop to iterate over this dictionary and print "My <brand> is <color>"
# for each of the cars.


# Exercise 4.4
# Try and print the same statement again in Exercise 4.3, but now
# use string formatting. Is that simpler or more complex for you?
