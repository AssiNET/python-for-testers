# Exercise 2.1
# Create a new function print_car_info_21() that prints the text
# "This is a 2019 Ford Focus" to the console output
# Call the function afterwards to see if it works


# Exercise 2.2
# Create a new function print_car_info_22() that takes a single
# argument 'year' containing the year and prints the text
# "This is a <year> Ford Focus" to the console output
# Call the function afterwards using the parameter value 2018
# to see if it works


# Exercise 2.3
# Create a new function print_car_info_23() that takes three
# arguments ('year', 'make', 'model') and prints the text
# "This is a <year> <make> <model>" to the console output
# Call the function afterwards using the parameter values (2017, Fiat, Punto)
# to see if it works


# Exercise 2.4
# Create a new function print_car_info_24() that does the same as
# the previous method, but this time assign a default value of "Punto"
# to the model
# Call the function afterwards using the parameter values (2016, Fiat)
# to see if it works


# Exercise 2.5
# Call the function from exercise 2.3, but using named arguments
# in the order (make, model, year) to demonstrate that you can provide
# arguments by name, not just by order. Use 2015 for the year to make it
# stand out from the other function calls
