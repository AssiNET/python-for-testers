# Exercise 6.1
# Create a method write_and_read_file() that does the following:
# Create a new file file.txt (Python will create a file that you
# try to open a file that doesn't exist) with "write" privileges.
# Write three random lines to the file and close it.
# Reopen the file and print its contents.

# Exercise 6.2
# Create a method append_to_file() that reopens the file you
# created in the previous exercise and appends two more lines
# to it. Print the contents to the console output once again
# to check whether or not it is working. Think about placing
# line breaks properly to make your file humanly readable!
